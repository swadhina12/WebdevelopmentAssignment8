### Q.4 Whats component? Types of component?
Ans:In React, a component is a reusable and self-contained piece of code that encapsulates the logic and rendering of a specific UI element. Components are the building blocks of React applications, allowing developers to create modular and maintainable code.

There are two main types of components in React:

1-Function Components:

Function components, also known as stateless components, are defined as JavaScript functions that accept props (properties) as input and return JSX (JavaScript XML) elements as output. They are simple and primarily focused on rendering UI based on the provided props.
Here's an example of a functional component:

```JavaScript
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}
```
2-Class Components:

Class components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They have more advanced features compared to function components, such as managing local state and lifecycle methods. Class components are useful for more complex UI elements that require internal state management or access to lifecycle events.
Here's an example of a class component:

```JavaScript
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
In addition to these main types, React also supports other types of components:

Class Components (using Hooks):

With the introduction of React Hooks, it's now possible to write functional components that can manage state and use lifecycle methods. Hooks, such as useState, useEffect, and useContext, allow developers to add state and other React features to functional components, blurring the distinction between function and class components.
Here's an example of a functional component using Hooks:

```JavaScript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component updated');
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Higher-Order Components (HOC):

Higher-Order Components are functions that take a component as input and return a new component with enhanced functionality. HOCs are used for code reuse, cross-cutting concerns, and adding additional props or behavior to components.
Here's an example of a Higher-Order Component:

```JavaScript
import React from 'react';

function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log('Component mounted');
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}
const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello, World!</div>;
const EnhancedComponent = withLogger(MyComponent);
```
These are the main types of components in React: function components, class components, class components using Hooks, and Higher-Order Components (HOCs). Each type has its own use cases and benefits, allowing developers to structure their code and build complex UI hierarchies in a modular and reusable manner.
