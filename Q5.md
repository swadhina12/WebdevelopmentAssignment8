### Q.5 Difference between class & function based component?
Ans:The main difference between class-based components and function-based components in React lies in how they are defined, their syntax, and the features they support. Here are the key distinctions:

>Class-based Components:

1-Syntax: Class-based components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They use the render() method to return JSX (JavaScript XML) elements. Additional lifecycle methods like componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), etc., can be implemented for more advanced functionalities.

2-State and Lifecycle: Class components have access to local state through the this.state object. State management methods, such as setState(), are used to update and manage the component's state. Class components can also utilize lifecycle methods like componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount() to perform actions during specific stages of the component's lifecycle.

3-Lifecycle Methods: Class components support a wide range of lifecycle methods, including componentWillMount(), componentDidMount(), componentWillUpdate(), componentDidUpdate(), componentWillUnmount(), and more. These methods allow developers to control behavior and perform actions during different phases of the component's life.

4-Context and Refs: Class components have built-in support for accessing React's context API and creating and managing refs to interact with DOM elements.

5-Usage of 'this' keyword: Class components use the this keyword to access props, state, and methods within the component's scope.

>Function-based Components:

1-Syntax: Function-based components are defined as JavaScript functions that accept props as input and return JSX elements as output. They are simpler and more concise compared to class-based components. With the introduction of React Hooks, function components can also utilize state and lifecycle features.

2-State and Lifecycle with Hooks: Function components can use React Hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, etc., to manage local state and incorporate lifecycle functionality. Hooks allow function components to have their own state using the useState hook and perform side effects or access context using the useEffect and useContext hooks.

3-Simplicity: Function components are generally considered more lightweight and easier to understand compared to class components, especially for simpler UI elements that don't require complex state management or lifecycle methods.

4-Performance: Function components are optimized by React to have better performance than class components, primarily due to the absence of the overhead associated with class instantiation.

5-Usage of 'this' keyword: Function components don't use the this keyword since they don't have their own instance. Instead, props and other variables are accessed directly within the function's scope.

In summary, class-based components provide access to advanced features like local state, lifecycle methods, context, and refs, while function-based components offer a simpler and more lightweight syntax. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, function components can now incorporate state and lifecycle functionalities, blurring the distinction between the two types of components. Hooks enable developers to write function components that can handle complex state management and utilize lifecycle methods, making them more versatile and favored in modern React development.
