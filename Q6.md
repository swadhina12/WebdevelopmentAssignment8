### Q.6 Explain react component life cycle ?
Ans:In React, component lifecycle refers to the different stages a component goes through from its creation to its removal from the DOM. Each stage in the lifecycle provides specific methods that can be overridden to perform actions or implement behavior at that particular stage. The component lifecycle consists of three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

Mounting Phase:

1-constructor(): This is the first method called when a component is created. It is used to initialize state and bind event handlers.

2-static getDerivedStateFromProps(): This method is called before rendering and allows the component to update its internal state based on changes in props.

3-render(): The render method is responsible for returning JSX, defining the component's UI structure.

4-componentDidMount(): This method is invoked immediately after the component is mounted to the DOM. It is commonly used for making API calls, setting up subscriptions, or initializing third-party libraries.
Updating Phase:

5-static getDerivedStateFromProps(): Similar to the Mounting phase, this method is called when new props are received, allowing the component to update its internal state based on the changes.

6-shouldComponentUpdate(): This method determines whether the component should re-render or not. By default, it returns true, but it can be overridden to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary renders.

7-render(): The render method is called again to update the component's UI based on the changes in state or props.

8-componentDidUpdate(): This method is invoked after the component is re-rendered. It is useful for performing side effects, such as updating the DOM or making additional API calls based on the changes.

>Unmounting Phase:

1-componentWillUnmount(): This method is called just before the component is removed from the DOM. It provides an opportunity to clean up any resources, subscriptions, or event listeners created in the component's lifecycle.
Additionally, there are a few other lifecycle methods that are less commonly used or have been 

>deprecated in newer versions of React:

1-componentWillMount(): Deprecated. Similar to componentDidMount(), but with less predictable behavior.

2-componentWillReceiveProps(): Deprecated. Use componentDidUpdate() or static getDerivedStateFromProps() instead.

3-componentWillUpdate(): Deprecated. Use shouldComponentUpdate() or componentDidUpdate() instead.

It's important to note that with the introduction of React Hooks, function components can also utilize lifecycle functionality through the useEffect hook. The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects, such as subscribing to events or fetching data, based on changes in state or props.

Understanding the component lifecycle is crucial for managing state, performing side effects, and optimizing performance in React applications. However, it's worth mentioning that in recent versions of React, some lifecycle methods have been deprecated or have recommended alternatives due to improvements in the framework.
