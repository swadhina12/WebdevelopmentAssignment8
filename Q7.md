### Q.7 Explain Prop Drilling in React & Ways to avoid it?
Ans:Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing down props through multiple layers of components, even if some intermediate components don't directly use those props. This can occur when a component needs to pass data to a deeply nested child component, and the props have to be passed through all the intermediary components in the component tree.

While prop drilling is a common approach, it can lead to code maintenance issues, decreased code readability, and increased complexity. Additionally, it can become problematic when the application scales or when changes need to be made to the prop structure.

To avoid prop drilling, here are a few techniques and patterns you can use:

>Context API:

React's Context API allows you to create a "context" that holds data and provides it to components deep within the component tree without explicitly passing props through each intermediate component. It helps in sharing data across components without relying on prop drilling.

>UseReducer and useContext:

You can combine the useReducer and useContext hooks to create a state management solution that eliminates the need for prop drilling. By defining the state and actions in a centralized location and providing access to the state using the useContext hook, you can avoid passing props down the component tree.

>React Redux:

React Redux is a popular library for state management in React applications. It provides a centralized store that can be accessed by components anywhere in the component tree. By connecting components to the store using the "connect" higher-order component, you can access and update the store without the need for prop drilling.

>Custom Hooks:

You can create custom hooks to encapsulate logic and state management. By abstracting the data-fetching or state management code into a custom hook, you can reuse it across components without the need for prop drilling.

>Component Composition:

Instead of passing props through multiple layers of components, consider restructuring your component hierarchy to make use of composition. Create higher-level components that encapsulate common functionality and data, reducing the need for passing props down the tree.

>React Query or Apollo Client:

If your application involves fetching data from APIs, libraries like React Query or Apollo Client can handle data fetching and caching efficiently. These libraries provide hooks that allow components to fetch and manage data without the need for explicit prop drilling.

By utilizing these techniques and patterns, you can avoid excessive prop drilling in your React applications. It improves code maintainability, reduces complexity, and enhances the overall development experience.
